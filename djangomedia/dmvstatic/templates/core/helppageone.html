This tutorial will help you get started using the CRdata system.

<h2>Setting up an account</h2>

<p>You may use the CRdata system in one of two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>AnonymousUser</li>
<li>A personalized Login Name that you create</li>
</ul>
<br>

If you do not want to set up an account you can use
CRdata as <b>AnonymousUser</b>.  You will have all of the same functionality
on the system as a user with a login, but none of your data will be saved long term.

Other users who use the system as <b>AnonymousUser</b> will have the ability to see your data and results.

Your data and results will be saved until you or another <b>AnonymousUser</b> delete them.

If you don't want others to see your data and results then you should go ahead and create your own personal account.

<p>
To set up an account on the CRdata system go to the 

<a href="{%url core.views.userlogin%}">Sign in</a>
page and underneath the <b>Login</b> button is

<a href="{%url core.views.usercreate%}">Create User</a>.

<h2>Data</h2>

<p>
Once you have chosen your account type you are ready to upload data to CRdata.

Go the <b>Data</b> tab
and click on

<a href="{%url core.views.dataupload%}">Upload</a>.
</p>

<p>
Currently, all input data must be in tabular format and saved in Comma
Separated Values (CSV) file format. CSV format files are plain
text and can be easily generated with text editors, Microsoft Excel, Open Office,
Google Docs and Spreadsheets and
other spreadsheet programs. The first row and column in CRdata input
files are assumed to be row and column labels (names).  These label names
can be any mixture of the letters A - Z and numerals 0 - 9, otherwise known as
alphanumeric characters.
</p>


<p>
The <b>View</b> menu item takes you to a listing of the files you have uploaded and allows you to view the contents of the individual data files.

<p>
The <b>Delete</b> menu item allows you to delete data files that you have already uploaded.
<br>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>
The Analysis tab contains the algorithms available in CRdata that allow you to visualize 
your data in different ways. Simply go to the Analysis tab and pick an algorithm that you are interested in. 
After picking an algorithm from the menu, you will see your list of data files in a drop down menu. 
Select one or more data files from the drop down and then click on the <b>Submit</b> button.  
You will automatically be presented with your results.

<h2>Gallery</h2>

<p> 

The Gallery is a repository of all of your results.  New results are simply appended to the existing results set.
<p>
Gallery One is a simple listing, where as Gallery Two includes thumb nails at the bottom of the page for easier navigation.
<p>
The <b>Delete</b> menu item allows you to delete your analysis results.
