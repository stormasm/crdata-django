Currently, all input data must be in tabular format and saved in Comma
Separated Values (CSV) file format. CSV format files are plain
text and can be easily generated with text editors, Microsoft Excel, Open Office,
Google Docs and Spreadsheets and
other spreadsheet programs. The first row and column in CRdata input
files are assumed to be row and column labels (names).

The <b>View</b> menu item takes you to a listing of the files you have uploaded and allows you to view the contents of the individual data files.
