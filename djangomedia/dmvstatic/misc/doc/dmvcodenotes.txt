Dmv Code Notes

How the uploaded file sequence works.

readUploadedFileAndWriteToDisk

1. Read file from user (upload file)
2. Write this file to the disk in tmp directory

checkUploadedFileAndWriteTabSeparated

3. Read file back into R from disk, 
this is checking to make sure everything is good,
and if thing are cool then continue -- else R will throw an error
4. Write back to disk tab separated

readFileAndPickleToDictionary
5. Read file back from disk and

writeDataDictionaryToDatabase
6. Pickle a python dictionary to the database.

This guarantees going forward several things.

1) In the future user can retrieve his/her data from us,
and display in their spreadsheet because we are storing
the data in a tab separated format.

2) This allows the internals of our code to always know
that when we pull data out of the database it is always
in the exact same format, which is tab separated.
