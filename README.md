# crdata-django

This is the legacy crdata django code based on Python.

The latest and greatest Ruby code is [here](https://github.com/stormasm/crdata).

This legacy code was written prior to bringing Rajiv on to the project and
was more a proof of concept.

Once Rajiv came on board we funded two more developers to create a Ruby
version of the code with *crdata-django* as the model of what work we
wanted to achieve.

The initial commit for the Ruby project was done on
[July 2, 2010](https://github.com/seerdata/crdata/commit/f506124d8d1d7c0b24db35cfc01235ebf3e3ad9f).
